/**
 * Opaque handle for an 8x8 single-precision matrix fragment held in a SIMD group's
 * registers - the software view of a hardware matrix-unit fragment (Apple Metal's
 * {@code simdgroup_float8x8}).
 *
 * <p>On a GPU backend that supports matrix units, values of this type never exist as
 * heap objects: the {@code KernelContext.simdgroupMatrix*} intrinsics that produce and
 * consume them are replaced by hardware instructions, and the fragment lives in
 * registers as a single SSA value (the Metal backend maps this type to the
 * {@code SIMDGROUP_FLOAT8X8} kind, exactly as it maps {@code Float4} to {@code float4}).
 *
 * <p>The {@code float[64]} storage here is only used when a kernel runs on the JVM
 * (sequential reference execution / validation), where the same intrinsics fall back to
 * the plain-Java semantics in {@code KernelContext}. Row-major, {@code values[i*8 + j]}.
