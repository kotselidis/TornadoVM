 *
 * The spill slot area also includes stack allocated memory blocks (ALLOCA
 * blocks). The size of such a block may be greater than the size of a normal
 * spill slot or the word size.
 * <p>
 * A runtime can reserve space at the beginning of the overflow argument area.
 * The calling convention can specify that the first overflow stack argument is
 * not at offset 0, but at a specified offset. Use
 * {@link CodeCacheProvider#getMinimumOutgoingSize()} to make sure that
 * call-free methods also have this space reserved. Then the VM can use the
 * memory at offset 0 relative to the stack pointer.
